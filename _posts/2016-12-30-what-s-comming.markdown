In 2016 the development of condor ir was a bit slow, after a fast period
towards the start of the year life happened and the project got a little bit
delayed.

Nevertheless, we got some nice features in, we got nice extraction of bibtex,
isi and froac fileformats, a complete database schema for bibliographic
information and a nice CLI that allows us to work with bibliography sets, term
document matrices and search engines.

We also jumped from mongo db, a nice but not as scalable solution for data
storage, to a strict postgresql schema.
